 **Audio-Visual Natural Scenes (AVNS) dataset**
 
This is the official repository of the AVNS dataset. For details of how we created the dataset, please refer to our ICASSP paper: “Multi-modality Speech Recognition Driven by Background Visual Scenes”. Available on IEEE: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10446142

**Dataset**

The AVNS dataset covers a total of 11 scene classes: road, metro station, metro, bus, airport, canteen, playground, shopping mall (indoor), market (outdoor), park, and wild. 

Data was recorded either in a fixed position, referred to as static recording, or while recording people in normal speed movements, referred to as mobile recording.
