The AVNS dataset covers a total of 11 scene classes: road, metro station, metro, bus, airport, canteen, playground, shopping mall (indoor), market (outdoor), park, and wild. 
Data was recorded either in a fixed position, referred to as static recording, or while recording people in normal speed movements, referred to as mobile recording.
